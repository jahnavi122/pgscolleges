                    <h3>About us</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">PGS was established in 1988 with the intention to provide the right guidance to students who are career minded and ambitious. Right from its inception, PGS has had an obsession with quality which till today is the hallmark of the institution.<br><br>

PGS has always gone that extra distance to ensure that students have the best faculty to teach them as also the right ambience to set the backdrop for the best learning experience. We make sure that our campuses set a bench mark in quality and standard. Neat classrooms with modern up-to-date teaching methods and aids are PGS’s forte.<br><br>

The interest of students is given top priority and counseling is taken up to help students identify their interests and careers. PGS’s course structure is comprehensive and scientifically designed for both teachers and students to evaluate progress.<br>

We have three compact learning centers in Hyderabad city (at Banjara Hills, Himayatnagar and Sainikpuri) and two residential learning centers in Kompally on the outskirts of Hyderabad city – a separate campus for girls and a separate campus for boys. We offer a variety of integrated training programs for students who have completed Class XII.<br><br>

We are happy to share that since 2004, 2280 PGS students achieved their cherished goal of getting admission offers from Top-Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon , Google, Flipkart and many more.<br><br>

When students come to PGS, they get the assurance of expertise, commitment and dedication.</p>

            <div class="col-6"><h3>Concept of academy</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                PGS is a leading service provider to students preparing for National Level Entrance Exams. Our Academy is a 25-year-old institute offering programs for various competitive exams Although it’s not really part of our name, we are proud that PGS is popular as an ‘academy.’ Yes, it’s not just another coaching institute or training institute. We like to think of PAGE as an academy because we see ourselves as providers of education which is complementary, or sometimes even supplementary, to what is provided in regular schools and junior colleges. We are not in the market only to drive people towards engineering- or medical-based entrances but to provide students with the skills and knowledge they require to carve out lucrative and socially responsible careers for themselves.

Traditionally “Academy” referred to a garden or grove near Athens called Akademia (so named after the hero Academus) and a sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and skill, where Plato founded his school of philosophy approximately in 385 BC and where he held philosophical conferences with his followers. Today, it means an institute of higher learning of quality and standard. We are happy that over the 25 years it has been in the market, PGS has proved itself to be a true academy of learning and culture. Our ultimate intention is to partner mainline education providers with expertise in education that is in line with market realities and expectations thereby ensuring that the students get a well rounded education and the best possible opportunities to prepare them for a fulfilling life.</p>
